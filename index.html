    <p><b>The Gods Are Not To Blame </b>is a 1968 play and a 1971 novel by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Rotimi">Ola Rotimi</a>.[1] An adaptation of the Greek classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex">Oedipus Rex</a>, the story centres on Odewale, who is lured into a false sense of security, only to somehow get caught up in a somewhat consanguineous trail of events by the gods of the land.[2]

        The novel is set in an indeterminate period of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yor%C3%B9b%C3%A1land">Yoruba kingdom</a> . This reworking of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex">Oedipus Rex</a> was part of the African Arts (Arts d'Afrique) playwriting contest in 1969. Rotimi's play has been celebrated on two counts: at first scintillating as theatre and later accruing a significant literary aura.[3] This article focuses specifically on the 1968 play.

    <p> <b>Odewale:</b> The king of Kutuje, who had risen to power by unknowingly murdering the old king, King Adetusa, whom, also not to his knowledge, was his father. The manner in which he kills his father is revealed in a flashback when his childhood friend, Alaka, comes to Kutuje to ask him why he was not in the village of Ede as he said he would be when he departed at age thirteen. Similar in nature to the Greek play, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Tyrannus">Oedipus Tyrannus</a> his royal parents receive a prophecy from Baba Fakunle that Odewale would grow up to kill them both.[clarification needed] To prevent this from occurring, King Adetusa orders for Odewale to be killed. Instead, he is wrapped in a white cloth (symbolizing death) and left in a bush far from Kutuje. He is found and picked up by a farmer hunter Ogundele and raised by him along with his wife Mobe. Odewale is confronted by Gbonka, a messenger, who tells of the event that lead to King Adetusa's end. Along with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Tyrannus">Ogun</a> Priest, it is revealed to him that the old king was his father, and that Ojuola was his mother.
